## Conclusion

Based on Allegheny County Walk Scores, the Central Business District is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. However, if one is talking about livability, the Central Business would not be the best city because most of this neighborhood is not residential. Also, important metrics like crime statistics, public school rankings, air quality, parking, etc have not been factored into my finding. This proves that it's important to consider multiple metrics when one attempts to solve a problem.
